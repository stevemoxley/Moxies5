Moxies5
=======

The Moxies is a game I made in C# using XNA Game Studio.  Its a "life" simulator. The Moxies are animals that the player
takes care of like a virtual pet.  Its my first attempt at implementing an Entity-Component System, A* Pathfinding algorithms,
and object serialization with XML.
